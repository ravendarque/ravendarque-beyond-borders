# ðŸ“„ PRD: Dataset of nations, peoples, and groups under oppression

## 1. Objective
Produce a **structured YAML dataset** of flags representing countries, peoples, and oppressed groups. This will be used as the source of truth for creating the flag data for the Beyond Borders application

The dataset should include the groups listed in section 2 of this document

This file will serve as a reusable knowledge base for further applications (visualizations, websites, educational resources).

## 2. Categorization Rules
These following categories will be used to find and classify each flag entry:

1. **Authoritarian State**  
   - UN-recognized sovereign states with limited/no political freedoms, dictatorship, or monarchy with repression.  
   - Examples: North Korea, Eritrea, China, Iran.  

2. **Occupied / Disputed Territory**  
   - Regions with partial or no international recognition, under foreign occupation, or secessionist entities.  
   - Examples: Palestine, Tibet, Western Sahara, Chechnya, Kosovo.  

3. **Stateless / Displaced Peoples**  
   - Nations or ethnic groups without recognized statehood, often facing persecution.  
   - Examples: Kurds, Uyghurs, Rohingya, Tamils, Ogaden Somalis, Baloch.  

4. **Oppressed / Marginalised Groups**
   - Groups facing systemic discrimination or social exclusion within a state.
   - Examples: LGBTQIA+ communities, Indigenous peoples

1. **Define Scope**  
   - List all entities to be included (authoritarian states, occupied territories, stateless peoples).  

2. **Collect Flag Assets**  
   - Locate official or widely recognized flag SVGs on Wikimedia Commons.  

3. **Draft Entries**  
   - Write `name`, `svg_url`, and `description` for each entity.  

4. **Categorize**  
   - Assign `type` according to rules in Section 4.  

5. **Write Reasons**  
   - Summarize why each entity is considered under oppression (max 1â€“2 sentences).  

6. **Compile YAML**  
   - Follow the exact format in Section 2 and Section 5.  
   - Validate with a YAML linter to ensure no syntax errors.  

7. **Save File**  
   - Path: `/data/flag-data.yaml`
