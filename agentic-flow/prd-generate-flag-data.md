# ðŸ“„ PRD: Dataset of Oppressed Nations, Peoples, and Marginalised Groups

## 1. Objective
Produce a **structured YAML dataset** of flags representing countries, peoples, and marginalised groups under oppression. This will be used by another prompt to create the coloured flag borders in the app

The dataset should include:  
- Authoritarian states  
- Occupied / disputed territories  
- Stateless or oppressed peoples  
- LGBTQIA+ communities

This file will serve as a reusable knowledge base for further applications (visualizations, websites, educational resources).

## 6. Steps to Produce the File

1. **Define Scope**  
   - List all entities to be included (authoritarian states, occupied territories, stateless peoples).  

2. **Collect Flag Assets**  
   - Locate official or widely recognized flag SVGs on Wikimedia Commons.  

3. **Draft Entries**  
   - Write `name`, `svg_url`, and `description` for each entity.  

4. **Categorize**  
   - Assign `type` according to rules in Section 4.  

5. **Write Reasons**  
   - Summarize why each entity is considered under oppression (max 1â€“2 sentences).  

6. **Compile YAML**  
   - Follow the exact format in Section 2 and Section 5.  
   - Validate with a YAML linter to ensure no syntax errors.  

7. **Save File**  
   - Path: `/agentic-flow/outputs/flag-data.yaml`
