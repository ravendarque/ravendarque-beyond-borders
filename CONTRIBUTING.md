# Contributing to Beyond Borders

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Beyond Borders! This document
outlines the terms and expectations for contributors.

## Ethical Use and Mission

Beyond Borders exists to support marginalized groups, oppressed peoples, and
stateless nations. We use flag imagery to show solidarity and raise awareness.

**Important:** Flags themselves are not inherently harmful - many flags have
legitimate uses for solidarity and awareness. The restriction applies to the
_purpose_ and _intent_ of use, not to specific flag designs.

**This project explicitly prohibits:**

- Using flags to promote oppression or discrimination
- Creating flags for nationalist/racist purposes
- Using flags to harm marginalized groups
- Any use that discriminates against or oppresses people

**Example:** The Flag of Ireland can legitimately represent solidarity for
occupied Northern Ireland. However, using this Software to create it for the
purpose of promoting nationalist racism against people of colour would violate
our terms.
