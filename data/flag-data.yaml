Irish Travellers are an ethnic minority group in Ireland and the UK who face systemic discrimination in housing, employment, education, and healthcare. They experience high rates of poverty, poor health outcomes, and limited access to services. Travellers face prejudice, hate speech, and exclusion from mainstream society, with their traditional nomadic way of life often criminalized or restricted.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples face ongoing discrimination, dispossession, and inequality in Australia. They experience significantly higher rates of incarceration, poorer health outcomes, lower life expectancy, and barriers to education and employment. Despite constitutional recognition efforts, Aboriginal peoples continue to face systemic racism, land rights disputes, and the ongoing impacts of colonization including forced removal policies and cultural suppression.

        reason: "Since 28 December 2025, Iranian security forces have responded to nationwide protests with extreme violence, including unlawful killings, mass arbitrary arrests of children as young as 14, enforced disappearances, attacks on hospitals, and a near-total internet blackout. At least 28 protesters and bystanders were killed between 31 December 2025 and 3 January 2026, with estimates reaching thousands. Security forces including the IRGC and FARAJA have used live ammunition, shotguns with metal pellets, tear gas, and beatings against largely peaceful protesters. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented patterns of violations that may constitute crimes against humanity, including summary executions, torture, and denial of medical care. This flag represents solidarity with the Iranian people demanding fundamental rights, dignity, and political change in the face of systematic state repression."

        reason: "Since April 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a brutal civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Civilians have suffered mass atrocities including indiscriminate killings, sexual violence weaponized as war crimes, ethnic cleansing targeting non-Arab groups in Darfur (recognized as genocide by some authorities), deliberate attacks on medical and aid infrastructure, denial of humanitarian access, and widespread famine. Over 12 million people have been displaced, with millions at risk of starvation. UN investigators, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Oxfam have documented war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both warring factions. This flag represents solidarity with the Sudanese people caught in a devastating conflict with insufficient international response."

        reason: "Eastern DRC faces escalating conflict and immense humanitarian suffering as government forces, rebel groups (notably M23), and allied militias commit serious abuses with near-total impunity. Civilians face indiscriminate attacks using unguided rockets and explosives on densely populated areas, summary executions, gang rapes, abductions, ethnic targeting, mass displacement (over 7 million internally displaced), destruction of displacement camps and infrastructure, and denial of access to medical care, food, and water. Grave violations against children have tripled since January 2025, including killing, maiming, sexual violence, and forced recruitment. Humanitarian aid is severely impeded by funding cuts and security access problems. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and UN experts have documented violations that may amount to war crimes. This flag represents solidarity with the Congolese people, especially those in eastern regions facing systematic violence and displacement."

        reason: "Since the military coup of 1 February 2021, Myanmar's junta has escalated a campaign of widespread atrocities including indiscriminate air and artillery strikes on civilians, bombings of schools and hospitals, mass displacement (over 3.5 million internally displaced), arbitrary arrests and detentions (over 20,000 detained), torture, suppression of free expression, forced recruitment including of children, and targeting of ethnic minorities including Rohingya. More than 6,000 people have been killed. Grave violations against children have increased by over 400%, including killing, maiming, abduction, and recruitment. The junta uses scorched earth tactics, cluster munitions, and landmines, while blocking humanitarian access and causing economic collapse. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented patterns of violations that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

        description: "Four horizontal stripes: yellow, white, purple, and black representing people whose gender is outside the binary."
        reason: "Represents non-binary people and their visibility. Non-binary people face erasure, discrimination, and legal obstacles in many jurisdictions where legal systems only recognize binary gender categories. They are often denied accurate identity documents, face barriers to healthcare, experience high rates of discrimination and violence, and lack legal recognition of their gender identity. Non-binary people are frequently excluded from legal protections and face challenges accessing services, employment, and public facilities that respect their gender identity."

        reason: "Designed in 2018 by Daniel Quasar to emphasize progress and inclusion within LGBTQIA+ communities. The chevron arrow represents forward movement, while the additional stripes highlight marginalized groups: black and brown for LGBTQ+ people of color and those lost to or living with HIV/AIDS, and light blue, pink, and white for the transgender community. This flag acknowledges that while progress has been made, many within the LGBTQIA+ community still face disproportionate discrimination, violence, and exclusion, particularly trans people and people of color."

        description: "Progress Pride flag with an additional yellow triangle containing a purple circle representing intersex inclusion."
        reason: "Updated in 2021 by Valentino Vecchietti to explicitly include intersex people in the Progress Pride design. Intersex people face severe human rights violations including non-consensual medical interventions, forced sterilization, lack of legal recognition, and discrimination. The intersex symbol (purple circle on yellow) integrated into the Progress Pride flag highlights the need for bodily autonomy, visibility, and rights for intersex people alongside other marginalized LGBTQIA+ communities. Intersex people are often subjected to 'normalizing' surgeries in infancy without consent, violating their right to bodily integrity."

        reason: "Designed by Marilyn Roxie in 2010 to represent genderqueer people whose gender identity exists outside or rejects the gender binary. Genderqueer people face erasure, discrimination, and lack of legal recognition in many jurisdictions. They are often denied accurate identity documents, face barriers to healthcare, experience high rates of violence and discrimination, and lack legal protections. The flag represents resistance to binary gender norms and visibility for those whose gender identity is fluid, non-binary, or outside traditional categories."

        description: "Three horizontal stripes: pink (top), purple (middle, narrower), and blue (bottom)."
        reason: "Designed by Michael Page in 1998 to increase bisexual visibility. Bisexual people face unique forms of discrimination including biphobia, erasure, and invalidation from both heterosexual and LGBTQ+ communities. They are often told their orientation is a phase, face higher rates of mental health issues, and experience discrimination in relationships, healthcare, and social settings. Bisexual people, particularly bisexual women, face disproportionately high rates of sexual violence and intimate partner violence. The flag represents the overlap of attraction to same and different genders."

        reason: "Created around 2010 by Jasper V. to represent pansexual people who experience attraction regardless of gender identity. Pansexual people face erasure, invalidation, and discrimination similar to bisexual people, often being told their orientation doesn't exist or is confused with bisexuality. They face pressure to conform to binary understandings of attraction, experience exclusion from LGBTQIA+ spaces, and lack visibility in media and representation. Pansexual people also face discrimination in relationships and social settings, with their identity often dismissed or misunderstood."

The logo represents the unity of socialist and anarchist movements in opposition to fascism, with roots in historical anti-fascist movements including the German Antifaschistische Aktion of the 1930s. Anti-fascist activists face surveillance, criminalization, and violence from state authorities and far-right groups. In many countries, anti-fascist organizing is met with repression, while fascist and far-right movements receive protection or support from state institutions. This symbol represents solidarity with those resisting fascism, racism, and authoritarianism worldwide."
