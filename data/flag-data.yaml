        reason: "Since April 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a brutal civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Civilians have suffered mass atrocities including indiscriminate killings, sexual violence weaponized as war crimes, ethnic cleansing targeting non-Arab groups in Darfur (recognized as genocide by some authorities), deliberate attacks on medical and aid infrastructure, denial of humanitarian access, and widespread famine. Over 12 million people have been displaced, with millions at risk of starvation. UN investigators, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Oxfam have documented war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both warring factions. This flag represents solidarity with the Sudanese people caught in a devastating conflict with insufficient international response."

        description: "Sky blue field with a yellow-bordered red diagonal stripe from lower hoist to upper fly and a yellow five-pointed star in the upper hoist corner."
        reason: "Eastern DRC faces escalating conflict and immense humanitarian suffering as government forces, rebel groups (notably M23), and allied militias commit serious abuses with near-total impunity. Civilians face indiscriminate attacks using unguided rockets and explosives on densely populated areas, summary executions, gang rapes, abductions, ethnic targeting, mass displacement (over 7 million internally displaced), destruction of displacement camps and infrastructure, and denial of access to medical care, food, and water. Grave violations against children have tripled since January 2025, including killing, maiming, sexual violence, and forced recruitment. Humanitarian aid is severely impeded by funding cuts and security access problems. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and UN experts have documented violations that may amount to war crimes. This flag represents solidarity with the Congolese people, especially those in eastern regions facing systematic violence and displacement."

        description: "Three horizontal bands of yellow, green, and red with a white five-pointed star centered on the green band."
        reason: "Since the military coup of 1 February 2021, Myanmar's junta has escalated a campaign of widespread atrocities including indiscriminate air and artillery strikes on civilians, bombings of schools and hospitals, mass displacement (over 3.5 million internally displaced), arbitrary arrests and detentions (over 20,000 detained), torture, suppression of free expression, forced recruitment including of children, and targeting of ethnic minorities including Rohingya. More than 6,000 people have been killed. Grave violations against children have increased by over 400%, including killing, maiming, abduction, and recruitment. The junta uses scorched earth tactics, cluster munitions, and landmines, while blocking humanitarian access and causing economic collapse. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented patterns of violations that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. This flag represents solidarity with the people of Myanmar resisting military rule and demanding democracy, not the junta regime."
