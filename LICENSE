ETHICAL USE RESTRICTION

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, this Software and any
derivative works (including forks) may not be used:

1. To create flags, symbols, or imagery for purposes that promote:
   - Nationalism that oppresses marginalized groups
   - Racism, racial discrimination, or racial hatred
   - Hatred against oppressed peoples or stateless nations
   - Symbols of genocide, ethnic cleansing, or oppression
   - Any form of discrimination against marginalized groups

2. In any manner that harms, oppresses, or discriminates against:
   - Marginalized groups
   - Oppressed peoples
   - Stateless nations
   - Occupied territories
   - Any group facing systemic oppression

3. To support or enable systems of oppression or discrimination

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:

Flags themselves are not inherently harmful - many flags have legitimate uses
for solidarity and awareness. The restriction applies to the *purpose* and
*intent* of use, not to specific flag designs.

For example, the Flag of Ireland can legitimately represent solidarity for
occupied Northern Ireland and the 26+6=1 movement. However, using this Software
to create the Flag of Ireland for the purpose of promoting nationalist racism
against people of colour (whether immigrants or Irish-born) would violate this
restriction.

The same flag design may be used for legitimate solidarity purposes or misused
for harmful purposes. This restriction prohibits the latter - using this
Software to create flags for purposes that harm, oppress, or discriminate
against marginalized groups.

Violation of this restriction terminates your rights under this License
immediately. This restriction is a material term of this License. By using,
modifying, or distributing this Software (including by forking this repository),
you agree to be bound by this restriction.
